we can chain the angular and module called 'method chaining'. 
If errors are raised. to see error use browser developer tools
binding expressions in the view that are in the scope of the controller will not be evaluated
ng-src="" -->primarily used for binding the img 
Two way binding : keeps the model and view in sync at all times. 
ng-model can be used with input, select, textarea
ng-repeat is similiar to foreach loop in C#
ng-repeat contains $parent and $index to display the index in the list
events can be handled by ng-click option 
Filters: can do format, sort and filter data, It can be used with a binding expression or a directive\
limitTo: is used to filter the table rows 
lowercase:
uppercase: 
number:
currency:
orderBy:
ng-init directive allows you to evaluate an expression in the current scope
In real world application you should use a controller instead of ng-init to initialize values on the scope
ng-init should only be used for aliasing special properties of ng-repeat directive
ng-include directive is used to embed an HTMl page into another HTMl page
This technique is very useful when you want to reuse a specific view in multiple pages in your application
